This 100% online master's degree in Instructional Technology program is designed for all educators nationwide. It aligns with the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) Standards for Educators (ISTE-E). The Master's in Instructional Technology degree will provide you the skills to advance student learning in schools. The program is designed for teachers in the classroom and teacher leaders who have access to a classroom to implement technology-enhanced lessons. The M.Ed. in Instructional Technology is a fully online cohort program and will enable you to complete your degree in six semesters. You will complete five semesters, 30 hours, of specialized course work taught by full and part-time graduate faculty and experienced technical specialists. Once you complete the program, you will be prepared to utilize technology to support student learning effectively; teach technology applications, and provide professional development, mentoring/coaching, and essential technical assistance for other teachers who require support in their efforts to apply technology to facilitate P-12 student learning. Georgia Educators - The Instructional Technology Master's Degree satisfies requirements for an S-5 certification (service field) in Instructional Technology and increases a T-4 certification to a T-5. However, to qualify for the new S-certification and the certificate upgrade, you must pass the GACE assessment in Instructional Technology and add the new field to your existing GaPSC teaching certificate. This program will NOT lead to initial GaPSC teacher certification. Please check with the GaPSC to ensure you will receive an upgrade upon graduation. You should also check with your school/district to determine if you will receive a salary increase. You do NOT need to be working in an Instructional Technology position to receive the upgrade, and you can remain teaching in the classroom. Please check with your district for any restrictions. You must \"pass\" the GACE to add the new ITEC certification and upgrade your existing Georgia teaching certificate. Effective for Cohorts Starting FALL 2021 Kennesaw State University School of Instructional Technology & Innovation has been recognized by the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) as an ISTE Certification Provider. Kennesaw State is the first (and only) higher education program in Georgia to be awarded this distinction. What does this mean?
